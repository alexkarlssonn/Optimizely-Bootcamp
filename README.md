# Custom blocks in Optimizely Cms 12  
This is the Episerver Foundation repository but with my own custom blocks added.  
I created them as a learning experience to get a feel for how Episerver/Optimizely works.  
My custom blocks can be found under ./src/Foundation/Features/Blocks and all three of them start with Alex. So they should be easy to find.  
  
## How to build  
Please see the original foundation repo: https://github.com/episerver/Foundation  
I used a MacOS to set it up, but you should be able to set it up by following the instructions on the Foundation GitHub page.
